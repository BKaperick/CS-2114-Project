Notes on Activities and Tasks!

Task 	- A stack containing activity instances (must have at least one)
	-Starting the app creates a new 'Task' with a root activity 
	(e.g. a title screen)

Activity- A single page in an app.  Each has a number of attributes, one
	 of which being "Launch Mode"

LaunchMode	- Each activity has an attribute "LaunchMode"
		- Has one of Four modes which dictates how the activity 
		acts when called

LaunchMode="standard"
	- Multiple instances of this activity can be created
	- Each Task can have multiple instances of this activity
	- One instance can exist in multiple Tasks
	- Most commonly-used LaunchMode

LaunchMode="singleTop"
	- If an instance of this activity is at the top of the current
	task, and the user calls for the creation of this activity, the 
	current instance is used as opposed to creating a new instance
	Example:
		Task = new Task(A);
		A.launchMode = "standard";
		B.launchMode = "singleTop";
		A.calls(B);
		B.calls(A);
		A.calls(A);
		A.calls(B);
		B.calls(B);
		
	This sequence results in a Task : 
		B
		A
		A
		B
	      __A__

LaunchMode="singleTask"
	-When called, a new Task is created with this activity as its 
	root activity.  If an instance already exists, it will use 
	the existing instance, but move it to the new task (I think...)

LaunchMode="singleInstance"
	-Same as single task but is the only activity in its Task.  Any
	new activities called to be created on top of this one will be
	created in a different Task.
